- ✅ Many files already using the package namespace

## Current Integration Status

The package is **already integrated** into the main application:

### Composer Configuration
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../vallen-stored-procedure-factory"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "vallen/stored-procedure-factory": "*"
    }
}
```

### Service Configuration
```yaml
Vallen\StoredProcedureFactory\StoredProcedureFactory:
    bind:
        $hostname: '%env(resolve:SP_HOST)%'
        $pwd: '%env(resolve:SP_PASS)%'
        $username: '%env(resolve:SP_USER)%'
```

### Usage in Application
Many files are already using the package:
- `src/Service/OrderService.php`
- `src/Service/VallenDataService.php`
- `src/Service/PartService.php`
- `src/Service/CustomerService.php`
- And many more...

## Next Steps for Team

### 1. Update Remaining Files (Optional)
Some files still use the old `App\Factory\StoredProcedureFactory` import:
- `src/Controller/Cart/ScanToWebFakerAction.php`
- `src/Controller/ERP/SalesRepController.php`
- `src/Controller/ProductHistory/ProductHistoryController.php`
- And a few others...

To update these files, simply change:
```php
// Old
use App\Factory\StoredProcedureFactory;

// New
use Vallen\StoredProcedureFactory\StoredProcedureFactory;
```

### 2. Remove Old Factory (Optional)
Once all files are updated, you can safely remove:
- `src/Factory/StoredProcedureFactory.php`

### 3. Publish to Private Repository (Optional)
To make the package available across multiple projects:

1. Create a private Git repository for the package
2. Push the package code to the repository
3. Update composer.json to use the Git repository instead of path
4. Tag releases for version management

## Package Features Summary

### ✅ Dual Connection Support
- PDO with parameter binding (recommended)
- Native SqlSrv support (legacy)

### ✅ Security Features
